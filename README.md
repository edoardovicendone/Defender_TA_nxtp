# Technical Add-On for Windows Defender

This extension for SplunkÂ® is a rewrite of the Add-on already created by [pdoconnell](https://github.com/pdoconnell) ([TA-windows-defender](https://github.com/pdoconnell/TA-microsoft-windefender)) that we adapt to our needs and requirements.
At this point we would like to thank Patrick for the great work he has done with his project and from which we could learn a lot as well as all the other members of the [Splunk Community](https://community.splunk.com/t5/Community/ct-p/en-us) who publish their work. You are heroes :clap:

## Using this Application

This add-on is intended as a complement to the [Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/742/), which also manages the basic preparation of the extraction of the fields from the xml or raw events. If you have [installed](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/WindowsAddOn/latest/User/Install) this add-on you can also use this one to extract more information and present it according to the [CIM](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Overview).
